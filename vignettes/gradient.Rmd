To set up the computation for the `sinkhorn()` and `barycenter()` algorithms,
you will need to set `with_grad = TRUE` for 
`sinkhorn_control` and `barycenter_control`.

The exact formulae of gradients were given by Xie (2025),
and have been checked by the Automatic Differentiation library 
`ForwardDiff` in Julia.
