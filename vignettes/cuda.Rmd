The Wasserstein Index Generation (WIG) model relies on the
computationally expensive Optimal Transport methods,
and could be potentially very slow if the dimension of the problem
is very large.
In order to speed up the computation,
I have implemented some functions in CUDA for faster processing with GPU.
This is currently only available on Linux machines,
with CUDA installed.

To see if the `rwig` package on your machine is built with CUDA,
you can use the following function to check

```{r}
check_cuda()
```
